If you're lucky, slip through the cracks: 
she'll let you see in for a moment.
Holes in her chest make macabre souvenirs, 
fractured remains of the bullets. 

Inside: civil war; brain made of trenches
where instinct is combatting fear. 
Sensing your presence, she'll call troops to order
building barricades to keep herself safe. 

Isolation protects from intruders
whom she's known one too many times. 
The army assembled holds no reservations
both friendly and foe are displaced. 

She's found on the brink of belonging, 
seeks refuge but never abides. 
Walls build so soundly rarely collapse
and bullets by no means dissolve.

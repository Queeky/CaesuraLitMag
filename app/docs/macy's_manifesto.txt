Macy's Manifesto

Communism is okay. DDR will be a national sport and a national penalty. Free speech is encouraged as long as it stands in favor of Macy-donia's laws and Macy's personal ideals. 

[A family within borders]
Macy-donia considers its people a family; like a family, every individual has the interest of the state. (Heavily imply that you will be watched, but sugar-coat it.)

Macy-donia will be a nation that inspires extreme patriotism, with citizens ready and able to commit themselves at whatever time for whatever reason Macy-donia deems necessary. Macy-donia recognizes the value of its people and so will devote resources towards accomdating these people and fostering a permanent community. 

Macy-donia will be a country you'll never want to leave.

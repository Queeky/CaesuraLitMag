A man walks alone
Losing two legs but gaining one.
He sifts through a metal bin
Filled with garbage
Or is it gold?

Metal mosquitos
Drink the black blood of the Earth.
Mechanical ants
Grind away at the trunks of trees
And carry them away
To build their nests.

A woman strokes the white picket fence 
As she thinks of her family of four
And weeps.
She walks golden streets
Painted black with white and yelow lines.
Her labor has begun but she continues
Oblivious.

Bone white wagons moving
Across the plains
Blazing a trail of fire
Claiming everything
Believing it had no owner.
Men shun the natural law
While claiming to uphold it
And abuse all. 

In the inky darkness
The Chosen One reaches for
The shining handle of
A bronze lamp. 
But the lamp is empty.
The genie is dead
Or never existed. 
But you already know that
Don't you?

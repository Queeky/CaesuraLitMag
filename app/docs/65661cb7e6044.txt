When my brother was stressed
He folded paper cranes
Dozens and dozens of cranes.

Made of any material he could find
Napkins, cards, bulletins, 
Anything he could fold. 

Some he would give away, 
Some he would keep, 
I received a few.

After my brother left, 
We opened his closet
Thousands of cranes poured out.

don't wear leggings unless your shirt covers you butt; wear shorts with at 
least a five inch inseam; don't let your bra strap show; tank tops must have
straps at least three fingers wide; don't wear dresses and skirts unless they
come to the knee; wear your uniforms for cheer but never in the halls; only 
buy the running shorts with long spandex underneath them; wear a t-shirt
to the pool; don't wear your hair up for school dances unless your dress
covers your shoulders; don't dance like that, your dress is too low; don't wear
makeup if it's distracting, don't dye your hair an unnatural color; don't look
like you just rolled out of bed; don't look all done up like a whore; go home
and change, your outfit is distracting; your skirt is too short; but sir, these
are shorts with a five inch inseam; don't be a distraction to the boys; don't be
alone with them, they can't be trusted; this is how you escape a chokehold;
this is how you get your wrist out of his grip; this is how you know if 
someone is trying to take you; this is how you get into your car safely; this
is how you check for men in your car; this is how you drive away to get the
man out of your car; this is how you break a foot; this is how you break a
nose; this is how you get out from under a man; this is how you cry for help
so people don't ignore you: don't say what's happening; never say help;
never say rape; don't yell too softly; don't say what's happening; say there's a
fire; say there's a robber; whatever you do, do not say what's happening; they
will not stop if you say what's happening. don't sway your hips; bend down
at your knees when you drop your books; don't go into the living room
until you're fully dressed; don't leave your window open at night; don't go
downtown without a man; don't ever trust a man downtown; what was she
wearing?; what was she doing?; did she way no (don't ever say no); did she
say stop? (don't ever say stop); did she call it rape? (never say rape); did she
ask for help? (never say help); did she tell anyone it was happening? (don't 
say what's happening, don't say what's happening, whatever you do, do not
say what's happening, they will not stop if you say what's happening).

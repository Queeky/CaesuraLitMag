Welcome to the season
When all the leaves
Suspiciously find
Their way inside

Four becomes the
Shortest hour
With surprisingly
The longest shadows

Most colors are due
Back at the library; 
Just shades of brown
And three auburns left

There's always 
Something rejoicing
As it crackles beneath
Five cozy toes.

Enough distractions
have left the trees;
The beauty of patterns
Becomes simpler

Bright amber sun
Flooding through
Frost covered
Windows white

Don't hate the cold
It's just a means
To focus on 
Overlooked beauty.

I think I finally got my
Tomboy summer
I'm no longer quite so small that I
Hide behind my mother and my door
Not so afraid of the bugs, the breeze
My great progression outward
I sunbathe not for skin tone
But for salamander warmth
And perch in trees and high rocks,
Cawing like creaturely crow
Forgetting to check my phone
Whose screen I finally broke
Wandering without shoe and sock
Growing sweet to calloused feet
A delicious June retreat
Bright nights to fun for sleep
The rules too vaue to keep
I'm grass, I'm dirt, I'm blood, I'm free

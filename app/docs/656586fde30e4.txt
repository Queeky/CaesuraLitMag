"Maybe, in your world,
There's a happy little cloud that lives right here."
The clouds in my life aren't happy. 
I don't want them to move in, 
And live above me
But Bob tells me
There's beauty in the clouds. 

"And here, in front of the mountain,
Let's put in some foothills."
I don't like foothills. 
I want to go straight up 
Right to the top of the mountain. 
But Bob tells me
Enjoy the way there too.

"Filmed right here
In Muncie, Indiana."
I was born in Muncie. 
I spent much of my life trying to forget it,
Only to come back. 
But Bob tells me
Never be ashamed of my roots. 

"This is your world.
Anything you want can happen here."
I believe him. 
The real world is broken. 
There's far too much I can't control,
But Bob tells me
I can do this. 

Dad is sick. 
I feel overwhelmed.
Helpless. 
The only time Dad can sleep
Is when Bob Ross plays. 
I turn it on. 
I hear him. 
There's beauty in the clouds. 
Enjoy the way there too. 
Never be ashamed of my roots. 
I can do this. 
I get out a canvas. 
I paint a happy little tree.

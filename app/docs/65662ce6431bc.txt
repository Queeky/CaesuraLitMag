I should have prepared more. I'm grabbing boxes, trying to get them away from the grasps of the intruding guest. Their dripping cold bones creep further in, and the company embraces me making my light blue jeans a sopping dark blue. My hostess skills are on the backburner as I glance around at my soggy childhood. I decide it is time to say goodbye. I am the loch ness monster, and my basement is the Scottish Highlands as I attack the rude visitor in attempts to make it to higher ground. This storm needs to leave its attiude back in high school. I conquer what had been known as my basement and closed the door behind me. 

Unfortunately, the temporary tenant I left behind was a sore loser. They launched their revenge with no hesitation, causing my lights to blink as if something was in their eye and fade leaving me in a dull dim puddle. My feet sloshed through the damp, clammy essence of my now overthrown house. My reign was short lived and in vain seeing how the company had rented out my home for the time being. With nowehere left to run I sat and succumbed to the newly made owner's wishes.
